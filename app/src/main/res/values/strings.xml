        HOW TO USE THIS APP: \n
        \n
        MAP: total number of cases grouped by province \n
        (South Africa total is included) \n
        \n
        Tap on a province to select which is shown in CURVE \n
        \n
        CURVE: shows the increase in detected cases, for the selected province. \n
        \n
        Tap on curve to go back to map \n
        \n
        SPREAD simulation is meant to show how hard it is to avoid getting infected \n
        So wear your mask and get vaccinated. \n
        \n
        Statistics on the MAP are from the University of Pretoria. \n
        Currently stats are updated daily. \n
        \n
        Stay safe!

<p>Like everybody else around the world I am deeply affected by the Corvid-19 virus. Rather than watch Netflix all day (we do a lot of that too!) I am trying to keep informed with online information. Here is what I have found so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretoria University Data Science division is possibly the best source of up-to-date info on the spread of the disease. Check out their dashboard here: <a href="https://bitly.com/covid19za-dash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://bitly.com/covid19za-dash (opens in a new tab)">https://bitly.com/covid19za-dash</a></li>
<li>Using the data provided by the researchers above I have created an Android App to track the spread of the virus, which updates using their open data sources. The most up to date app is available here:<a href="http://circusscientist.com/CoronavirusSA.apk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" http://circusscientist.com/CoronavirusSA.apk (opens in a new tab)"> http://circusscientist.com/CoronavirusSA.apk</a></li>
<li>Somebody else made an online map based on the same information here: <a href="https://coronamap.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://coronamap.co.za/ (opens in a new tab)">https://coronamap.co.za/</a></li>
<li>There is more information at the official National Institute for Disease Control website here: <a href="http://www.nicd.ac.za/media/alerts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="http://www.nicd.ac.za/media/alerts/ (opens in a new tab)">http://www.nicd.ac.za/media/alerts/</a></li>
<li>Credit to the researchers at Pretoria University who compile the data: <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3724083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://zenodo.org/record/3724083 (opens in a new tab)">https://zenodo.org/record/3724083</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Everybody please stay safe, and above all, keep calm, stay home and wash your hands.</p>
